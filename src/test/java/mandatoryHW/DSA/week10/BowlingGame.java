		3.Do you know the Solution?
		  yes
		4.Do you have any alternate approaches? (Thing of alternate approaches)
		  yes
		5.Derive Pseudo code in paper (for the best chosen approach)
			Pseudo Code:
			
		6.Dry run the pseudo code with all test data from step #2
		  yes
		7.Write the code on notepad
		  yes
		8. Dry run the code with all test data from step #2
		  yes
		9. Write code on IDE (remember to add comments and practice coding standards)
		  yes
		10. Test the code + Debug the code (if any failures) Debug like a pro using debugging options of IDE
		  
		11. Check for any gaps of code optimization (if not optimized already in Step #9)
